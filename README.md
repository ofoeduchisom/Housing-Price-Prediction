A regression model built in R to predict housing prices using region-specific features. Demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

# Features
1. Cleaned and preprocessed housing data using R scripts

2. Engineered features like property age and location-based variables

3. Trained regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest)

4. Evaluated performance with R², MSE, and RMSE metrics

5. Visualized feature importance and residuals with ggplot2

Tech Stack
Language: R

Libraries: tidyverse, caret, randomForest, ggplot2
