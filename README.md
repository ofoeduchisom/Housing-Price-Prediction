 \*\*Housing Price Prediction in R\*\*

A regression-based predictive model built in R to estimate housing prices using region-specific features. This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## \*\*📋 Project Overview\*\*

\*\*🎯 Objective:\*\* Predict housing prices in a specific region and identify the most important factors driving property values.

\*\*💡 Approach:\*\* Use regression techniques on cleaned and engineered datasets to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

## \*\*🛠 Features and Methodology\*\*

### \*\*🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\*\*
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured correct data types.

### \*\*⚙️ Feature Engineering\*\*
- Created new variables such as property age and location-based features.
- Selected features based on correlation with sale price.

### \*\*📊 Modeling\*\*
- Trained regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using R², MSE, and RMSE metrics.

### \*\*📈 Visualization\*\*
- Explored relationships, feature importance, and residuals using ggplot2.

## \*\*💻 Tech Stack\*\*

\*\*Language:\*\* R  
\*\*Libraries:\*\* `tidyverse`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`

## \*\*📂 Files\*\*

- `Housing Data_Same Region.csv` – Raw dataset
- `House_prediction.R` – Complete script for data processing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation

## \*\*🚀 Running the Analysis\*\*

1. Open R or RStudio.
2. Load and run `House_prediction.R`.
3. Review summary outputs and plots in the console or RStudio Plots pane.

## \*\*🔍 Results and Insights\*\*

\*\*📈 Model Performance:\*\* Final model achieved R² = X.XX \*(replace with your actual score)\*

\*\*🏆 Top Predictive Features:\*\* X, Y, Z \*(replace with your findings)\*

### \*\*💡 Key Insights:\*\*
- Property age and location strongly influence price.
- Insights from the model can help identify high-value properties and trends in the local market.
